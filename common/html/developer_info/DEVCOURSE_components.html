<h1> OpenEV Components</h1>
<h2>GTK</h2>
A complete description of GTK can be found at the 
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK Website</a>.  A few points are
noted here:
<p>

<ul>
<li> GTK+ stands for "The GIMP Toolkit", and was created as part of the GIMP
  ("GNU Image Manipulation Program") implementation. It is used for
  creating graphical user interfaces.

<li> It is written in c, and in version 1.2.x (the version that OpenEV
     uses), it is composed of three main libraries: 
  <ol>
  <li> glib- provides definitions and routines for lists, trees, memory 
     allocation,basic data types (points, lines), etc.
  <li> gdk ("The GIMP Drawing Kit")- provides functions to trap keyboard and
     mouse events, and also to create a drawable window and draw basic 
     objects such as lines, points, rectangles etc.  The code in gdk is
     highly platform-dependent: event trapping, window drawing are
     very different between X-windows systems such as Linux, and Windows.
     gdk wraps these functions into a common API so that the gtk code can
     be less platform dependent.  Events include button press/click/releases,
     key pressing, cursor motion, etc.
  <li> gtk - provides more advanced widgets such as buttons, toolbars, 
     menus, tree views, file selection dialogs.  For instance, the gtk 
     button (gtkbutton.c) contains functions that know how to draw a button 
     in a window, and functions to execute when gdk events are trapped 
     (eg. what to do when the button is pressed, how to show it is 
     raised/lowered, etc).  These are based heavily on gdk functions.
   </ol>
<li> All of OpenEV's windows (the main viewing window, dialogs, etc.) build
upon the GtkWindow class.
<li> There is a helpful online <a href="http://www.moeraki.com/pygtktutorial/pygtktutorial/index.html">tutorial</a> describing GTK's python bindings 
with examples.
</ul>

<h2>OpenGL</h2>

<ul>
<li> OpenGL defines a hardware-independent software interface to graphics 
  hardware.  It specifies how various drawing-related functions should
  be defined (names, parameters, etc.).  The advantage of this is that
  code using this API can work with any hardware that supplies an OpenGL 
  driver.

<li> Mesa implements this API in software- if <path to OpenEV>/lib/Mesa 
  is added to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable on Linux/Unix, Mesa (libGL.so,
  libGLU.so) will be used.  Hardware-accelerated platforms provide the 
  interface without the need for Mesa, and are faster (though sometimes
  flakey).  Mesa relies on having
  the "glx" extension on X-Windows systems and the "wgl" routines on 
  Windows.  These extend the window systems enough so that the basic OpenGL
  commands can be defined in an efficient manner.  For instance, on X 
  servers, the glx extension allows OpenGL to bypass the X server's 
  involvement and render graphics directly in places where it is necessary for 
  performance.  For more on Mesa, see <a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/">this site</a>.

<li> The actual OpenGL commands in OpenEV are all at the c-level.
</ul>

An example of OpenGL commands follows:
<pre>
    if (view->dragging_mode)
    {
        gvgeocoord x[4], y[4];

        gv_view_area_map_pointer( view, 
                                  view->state.mpos_x, view->state.mpos_y,
                                  x+0, y+0 );
        gv_view_area_map_pointer( view, 
                                  view->last_mpos_x, view->state.mpos_y,
                                  x+1, y+1 );
        gv_view_area_map_pointer( view, 
                                  view->last_mpos_x, view->last_mpos_y,
                                  x+2, y+2 );
        gv_view_area_map_pointer( view, 
                                  view->state.mpos_x, view->last_mpos_y,
                                  x+3, y+3 );

	glColor3f(1.0, 0.5, 0.0);
	glBegin(GL_LINE_LOOP);
	glVertex2(x[0], y[0]);
	glVertex2(x[1], y[1]);
	glVertex2(x[2], y[2]);
	glVertex2(x[3], y[3]);
	glEnd();
    }
</pre>

This is the piece of code that draws the little orange rectangle when
you left-click and drag to zoom in on a region.  It takes the corner
coordinates of the area you dragged out, maps them into georeferenced
coordinates (the gv_view_area_map_pointer calls), sets the drawing
colour to orange (the glColor3f command), specifies that it is beginning
to draw a closed loop (the glBegin call), draws the vertices, then
ends the loop with glEnd.  Mesa or your hardware driver provide the
definitions of the OpenGL commands (glColor3f, glBegin, etc.). For
more, see the gv_view_area_expose function in gvviewarea.c, or the draw
functions in the layer c-code (gvrasterlayer.c, gvshapeslayer.c).

<h2>gtkglarea</h2>

GTK defines gtk_drawing_area as a base class for widgets that need a box
to draw into.  gtkglarea extends this class to allow it to accept OpenGL
commands for drawing.  OpenEV's gvviewarea adds the concept of layers
and tools, and adds the OpenGL commands necessary for georeferenced
display, 3D, etc.  For more information, see 
<a href="http://sal.kachinatech.com/F/3/GTKGLAREA.html">this site</a>.

<h2>proj</h2>

Proj is used by GDAL to do projection transformations, for instance 
between lat/longs and utm. OpenEV will function without proj, but in certain
cases the georeferenced display will not be correct.  For instance, when a 
georeferenced MFF2 file is read in, 
corner coordinates are specified in lat/longs even if the image is 
projected in utm coordinates.  In the utm case, GDAL must convert the corner
coordinates from lat/longs to utm prior to display so that the image does
not appear incorrectly warped.  Proj is used in this conversion.  For more 
information see the <a href="http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/">Proj website</a>. 

<h2>Gnuplot</h2>

Provides plotting functionality.  This is used in OpenEV through the 
gvplot.py wrapper.  For more information, see the
<a href="http://www.comnets.rwth-aachen.de/doc/gnu/gnuplot37/gnuplot.html">Gnuplot website</a>.
