PYTHON 2.3.1: The Python programming language and interpreter

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

NUMERIC PYTHON: An extension to Python that adds multidimensional array capabilities

This software was originally written by Jim Hugunin when he was at MIT, later
at CNRI.

Then Paul Dubois of LLNL became the "keeper". LLNL has released any 
contributions to it by LLNL personnel for free redistribution. 
However, many people have contributed to Numpy.  It is a classic open source effort 
that nobody "owns".  So, Numerical Python is placed in the SourceForge under 
the Python license. The LLNL license is in Legal.htm.

MESA: The Mesa 3D Graphics Library


                        Mesa Copyright Information


The Mesa distribution consists of several components.  Different copyrights
apply to different components.  For example, GLUT is copyrighted by Mark
Kilgard, some demo programs are copyrighted by SGI, some of the Mesa
device drivers are copyrighted by the respective authors.

Through version 3.0, the core Mesa library was been distributed under the
GNU Library General Public License.

In Mesa 3.1 (and later) the core library instead uses the XFree86 copyright.
The copyright was being changed so that Mesa could be integrated into the
XFree86 X server in order to support 3D hardware acceleration.  Mesa will
still also be supported as a stand-alone library.

If you have contributed code to Mesa in the past and don't want your
code included in the non-GNU LGPL version please contact Brian to
have your code removed.




Common questions about the copyright change
-------------------------------------------

Q1. Why was the copyright changed?

A1. Mesa is being integrated with XFree86 (the free X server for Linux
and other Unix-like operating systems) in order to better support
3D hardware on Linux.  All code used in XFree86 must use the XFree86
copyright.  3D hardware acceleration on Linux is long overdue.  The
Mesa copyright change will allow better hardware support on Linux in
the near future.


Q2. Is it legal to change the copyright?

A2. Yes, since I (Brian Paul) hold the copyright.


Q3. I contributed code to Mesa while under the GNU copyright and don't
agree with the new copyright.  What can I do?

A3. I'll remove any such code upon request.  So far, no one has made
this request.


Q4. The XFree86 copyright allows people/companies to release binary-only
works derived from the Mesa code.  Isn't that bad?

A4. It's somewhat unfortunate, but acceptable.  However, it really is in a
company's best interest to keep modification to open-source software in the
open-source domain.  See the open-source essays written by Eric Raymond for
the reasoning.  Also note that any such concerns can be applied to the
XFree86 project as well.  It seems to be doing well.



Attention Contributors
----------------------

If you want to contribute to the Mesa project please consider the
copyright issues.  If you contribute a bug fix or new feature to
an existing component you should agree to the copyright on that
component before submitting the bug fix or feature code.

If you want to contribute a new component, such as a new device
driver or demo program, then you can put whatever copyright you want
on your code.  Insert the copyright into all files to avoid confusion.
