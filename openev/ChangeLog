    size; several GUI tweaks.

2004-07-23  Paul Spencer <pspencer@dmsolutions.ca>

    * pymod/gvclassifydlg.py: restructured signals for OK and apply
    to prevent a problem where listeners to the ok signal or classifcation
    -changed signal could be called before the classification had actually
    been applied to the layer

2004-07-20  Paul Spencer <pspencer@dmsolutions.ca>
    
    * pymod/filedly.py: added patch from Zak (zjames@dmsolutions.ca)
    to handle manual input in a more reliable way
    
    * pymod/pgufont.py: added ability to load a font and report statistics

2004-07-02  Julien Demaria  <dem@acri-st.fr>

    * pymod/{gview.py, gviewapp.py, gvutils.py, gvviewwindow.py,
    pathutils.py}: Enhance project files portability : now filesystem
    filenames can be retrieved relatively to the project file if the
    absolute path doesn't exist. Implement also path separator portability.
    Use internally a PortablePath object (in pymod/pathutils.py).
    Backward compatibility with old project files.
    Tested between Linux, Solaris and Win32 systems.

    * pymod/gview.py: last_strech restored in projects reloading

    * pymod/gvutils: Change to don't crash OpenEV when a deserialization
    of a layer fails in projects reloading.

    * tools/open_subarea.py: New 'Open Subarea' tool added.

2004-05-12  Andrey Kiselev  <dron@ak4719.spb.edu>

    * pymod/gvrasterpropdlg.py: Preliminary support for changing
    projection on the fly.

2004-05-12  Julien Demaria  <dem@acri-st.fr>

    * pymod/gvmodule.c: Fix a bug in _wrap_gv_raster_layer_get_mesh_lod :
    this wrapper created a python double from a C int and then the
    mesh_lod was wrong (example 223.454).
    The wrapper now returns an int.
    This bug crashed OpenEV when for example we save a project,
    then reload it : if the wrong mesh is big on a lot of images of the
    project, this uses a lot of memory and done an allocation error.
    Note that all projects saved until this fix have wrong mesh_lods...

2004-04-21  Andrey Kiselev  <dron@ak4719.spb.edu>

    * gvutils.c: Fix comparisons with NODATA value.

    marked as NODATA.

    * pymod/gviewapp.py: New switch to control displaying "[NODATA]" marks
    in the tracker tool. Tweaks in 'Preferences' dialog.

    * pymod/gview.py: New methods in GvRasterLayer class: nodata_get(),
    nodata_set(), type_get(). get_nodata() method now deprecated (though,
    it does the same as nodata_get).

    * pymod/{gv.defs, gvmodule.c}: Added wrappers for
    gv_raster_layer_nodata_set(), gv_raster_layer_nodata_get() and
    gv_raster_layer_type_get().

    from the valid data.  This fixes some esoteric "streaking" problems. 

2002-10-08  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvraster.c: Modified gv_raster_build_poly_transform() to 
    back off using the highest possible order polynomial if the
    CRS_compute_georef_equations() call fails.  This ensures that 
    underdetermined sets of GCPs (ie. those with linear dependencies)
    can still produce useful polynomials, even if they are only 1st order.

2002-09-30  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvnodetool.c, gvareatoolc, gvshapesfile.c: try to maintain closed
    ring integrity while editing areas, and enforce it when saving to 
    shapefiles.

    * gvshapeslayer.c: Fixed some quirks with display list support.  
    Ensure that selected shapes are drawn (get rid of hit_selected). 
    Also ensure that the display list is wiped in case of selection or
    display change events. 

2002-09-27  Paul Spencer  <pgs@magma.ca>
    
    * gvshapeslayer.c, gvshapeslayer.h: added display lists to
    speed up rendering of shapes layers and added antialiasing
    support for line layers

    the white lines.

2002-09-16  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvviewarea.c: Ensure depth buffer is cleared before doing
    a render_to_func. This fixes problems printing 3D views at 1:1. 

2002-09-12  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * oeattedit.py: Gillian added the ability to create new fields.

    project files, and restored properly.

    * gvviewarea.c: ensure GL_NORMALIZE and GL_DEPTH_TEST are
    disabled in 2D mode (gl_view_area_expose()).

2002-09-10  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * added get_height_scale() method on GvViewArea.

2002-08-09  Paul Spencer <pgs@magma.ca>

    * Reimplemented the GvProperties using symbol tables and integer
    quark ids.  Must faster performance with many properties in one list.
    Memory for strings never recovered, but only one copy of any given
    string in the string table.

2002-07-23  Paul Spencer <pgs@magma.ca>

    * added pgutextarea.py, a simple scrollable text widget (read-only)

2002-07-18  Paul Spencer <pgs@magma.ca>

    * gvshapefile.c, gvshapes.h: added gv_shapes_to_dbf to allow a
    GvShapes container's attributes to be saved directly to a DBF
    file without needing to save the whole shape file.
    
    * gvmodule.c: added wrapper for gv_shapes_to_dbf

    support for the new GVSHAPE_COLLECTION primitive type.

2002-03-21  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvrenderinfo/gvvectorpropdlg: Added concept of _gv_ogrfs_point, 
    _gv_ogrfs_line and _gv_ogrfs_area properties on GvShapesLayers to
    indicate the styling for particular geometry types (as opposed to
    the _gv_ogrfs which would apply to all). Use this for symbols and
    labels in gvvectorpropdlg.py.  This responds to 528432 on SourceForge.

2002-03-20  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvviewarea/gvrasterlayer: added the render_exact flag to GvViewArea
    indicating the proper resolution textures should be loaded and
    used immediately rather than deferring their load till after the
    current render.  This is used by the printing engine to ensure 
    appropriate output.

2002-03-07  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvshape.c: added preliminary gv_shape_clip_to_rect() implementation.

2002-03-06  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    render operation.  Avoid texture thrashing hell in at least some 
    situations.

    * gvviewarea.c: fixed fit_all_layers to fetch/compute the volume
    for the 3d view setting.  Was uninitialized in some cases before.

    * html/*: updated mainwindow dialog and associated materials.

2001-11-29  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvraster.c, gvrasterlayer.c: Add use of autoscale_samples to
    determine the number of samples requested from a raster for scaling.
    Currently there is no gui element to set this preference.

2001-11-28  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvrasterlayer.c: added mesh_is_dirty flag, and code to update mesh
    on redraw if it is dirty.  Flag is set on geotransform-changed signal
    from prototype GvRaster.

    * gvraster.c: added set_gcps(), get_gcps() and geotransform-changed 
    signal.

2001-11-14  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * pymod/pyshell.py: fixed overwrite problem on windows using
    freeze()/thaw() on text widget.

    gv_shapes_get_properties.

2001-10-25  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvrasterlayer.c, pymod/openev.py: added support for a global 
    interp_mode preference to control the default subpixel interpolation
    mode of raster layers on creation.

2001-10-22  Paul Spencer  <pgs@magma.ca>

    * gvselecttool.c: in gv_selection_tool_deactivate(), moved call to 
        base class deactivate to after the tool specific deactivation to 
        ensure that the tool properly deregisters callbacks.

2001-10-22  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvviewarea.c: Call gv_view_area_state_changed() in 
    gv_view_area_add_layer() to ensure a refresh.  
    Bug 527 in DMSG Bugzilla.

2001-10-17  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * added support for composing 2D complex PCT with 1D enhancement LUT.

2001-10-16  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * pymod/gvviewwindow.py: added new enhancement options.

    * pymod/gview.py: added various enhancement related stuff.

    * gvrasterlayer.c: added autoscale and histogram functions on the
    view. 

    * gvraster.c: autoscale() can now be passed a sample set.

2001-10-12  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * pymod/gvrasterpropdlg.py: improved logic for setting the initial
    min and max of the scaling controls.  

    * gviewarea.c/gvrasterlayer.c: 

    GvLayer's now maintain a pending_idle flag indicating if they have 
    pending idle work that will lead to a refined redraw. 

    GvViewArea's now establish a timer after a redraw to keep track of
    the elapsed time since the last redraw.  This can be used via
    the gv_view_area_redraw_timeout() function for layer idle work handlers
    to find out if it is time for an intermediate redraw. 

    The gv_view_area_pending_idle_work() function may be used to check
    if there are layers with pending idle work for a view.  

    The GvRasterLayer idle work function now utilizes the above to ensure
    that a redraw occurs only onces all idle work is finished or the
    view wide timeout has occured.  This prevents extra redraws from
    occuring when many raster layers are displayed.

2001-10-11  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvviewarea.c: modified to avoid doing re-render on WIN32 if
    the view hasn't really changed.  This avoids slow rerenders with Mesa
    on windows in response to window expose events generated by covering
    dialogs.

2001-09-26  Paul Spencer  <pgs@magma.ca>

    * gtkcolorwell.c: fixed drawing code in _set_ functions to eliminate
    gtkcritical when changing color of a color well and fixed 'new' to
    not try to resize the preview widget.
    
    * gtkcolorwell.h: removed da member of gtkcolorwell class as it was
    not referenced (related to above)

2001-09-25  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * gvrasterlayer.c: Ensure idle tasks are cleaned up in finalize.

2001-09-16  Paul Spencer  <pgs@magma.ca>
    
    * gtkcolorwell.c: modified render to honour use_alpha setting and
    modified gtk_color_well_set_* to only call render/draw if widget
    is realized.

    * pymod/gvmodule.c: added python bindings for gtk_color_well_get_d
    function.
    
    * pymod/pgucolor.py: added python wrapper class GtkColorWell and
    modified ColorButton to extend GtkColorWell
    
    * gtkcolorwell.c: modified render code to honour transparency
    Note that this is not quite complete as it currently always 
    renders using transparency.

2001-09-14  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam@pobox.com>

    * pymod/gv.defs,gtkmissing.py: implement python bindings for
    the GtkColorWell class.

    * The GvRaster will down let GDAL down the decimation when the
    sample type is GvSMSample instead of GvSMAverage.  This gives a
    major performance boost for large images.

    * Added "_sample()" functions for float, and complex data, and
    use in gv_raster_new()
