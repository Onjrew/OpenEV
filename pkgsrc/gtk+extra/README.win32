This file contains instructions for building Gtk+Extra on win32.  There's a 
makefile.vc in the gtkextra directory, use it instead of makefile.msc (it's
missing a lot of targets).  The makefile needs some values defined in
nmake.opt.  Other than that, it should build fine.

Note that the file example seems broken but most everything else seems okay.

The resulting file is gtkextra-0.99.dll, put it in a directory in your path.
